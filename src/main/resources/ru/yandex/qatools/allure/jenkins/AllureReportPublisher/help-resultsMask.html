    Jenkins understands the Allure test report XML format.
    To use this feature, first set up your build to run tests, then specify the path to Allure Results Directories
    in the Ant glob syntax, such as **/target/allure-results. You can specify multiple patterns of files separated by commas.

    Once there are a few builds running with test results, you should start seeing something like
    <a target="_blank" href="https://raw.github.com/allure-framework/allure-core/master/allure-dashboard.png">this</a>.
